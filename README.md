## About project
My first JavaScript project, a classic guess number game, this game let you guess number from 1 - 20 (inclusively) and gives you a result. I learned to work and manipulate DOM from this project.

## Technologies
- Javascript 

## How to
1. download both Client and Server directories
2. In case you don't have Atlas mongoDB. Please sign up and create one. (You have to use it in step 3)
You have to create .env file in Server directory of the project. In that file create variable name 'MONGO_URI' assign your own connecting path to your Atlas mongoDB
open terminal and run 'npm install'
run 'npm start'. If it works, you should see 'server is listening on port 3000' (The port I set is 3000) printed to the console.
open new terminal, navigate to Client directory and run 'npm install'
run 'npm run dev' to open front end app
enter front end's url in your browser and enjoy the app!
